## Implementation of Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)

We provide our version of PGD implementations, which currently supports the datasets of (CIFAR-10), (CIFAR-100) and (SVHN), and the model architectures of (ResNet), (VGG-11)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556], (DenseNet), (PreActResNet) and (WideResNet), under $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ perturbations.

### News

- [2024.08.09] We released our version of PGD implementations based on [Robust Overfitting](https://github.com/locuslab/robust_overfitting).
